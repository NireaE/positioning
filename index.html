       <p>Hi, my name is Elias. I am a young adult who wants to get into the tech industry and pursuit the dream of becoming a software developer. Currently, I am an emerging software development professional and started my journey of becoming one as I take one step further toward my goal.</p>
       
       <p>I used to work at a small computer sales and maintenance business throughout high school and after. and from this experience, I learned the significance of effective communication, problem-solving, and hard work. I also enjoy discovering new stuff. How quickly the tech sector is evolving and changing always amazes me and is one of the reasons that let me get into this field.</p>
       
       <p>I enjoy playing sports like soccer, listening to music, and having fun with friends, and family to make nice memories because I believe in a healthy balance in your life.</p>
